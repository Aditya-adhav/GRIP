# TASK 2 Color Detection in Images
This Python project is designed to help you detect and identify colors in images using computer vision techniques. With the help of this project, you can extract dominant colors from an image, identify specific colors, and even create visualizations of color distributions.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the color detection project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

Required Python libraries can be installed using the following command:

pip install opencv-python

pip install numpy

pip install pandas


Acknowledgments
